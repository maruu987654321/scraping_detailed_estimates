There are two websites with similar information that I want to capture:
https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/KBH/detailed-estimates
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KBH/analysis?p=KBH&.tsrc=fin-srch

I am not 100% sure I have covered all that needs to be captured 
in the attached spreadsheet but this will give you a good starting idea.

I have a small linux server with some space on it and would l
ike the data captured and stored here. There is some other project saved 
here so would be important to create a separate folder to hold and run this data)

The script would run once a week (maybe on a Sunday afternoon) 
and capture all the data on the same list of stocks.

It would essentially track these data points for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, 
the oldest data would drop off / be deleted.

Once it collected the data, it would email a spreadsheet that tracked specific changes for 
instance, it would track weekly changes in Row 3, 4, 5, 7, 13, 15, 26, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34, 
35, 37, 38, 41, 48, 49, 50.

Need some way to get the report (maybe emailed after created)

Need some way to bulk download raw data files on each stock 
(maybe a spreadsheet that reads the stock names and then creates a 
file that can be downloaded with a terminal command or via a basic web interface.)

I am sure this is not very clear so let me know what questions you have.
